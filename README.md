# Network_speed_meter
 This is a Python script that creates a simple GUI application using Tkinter to display the network upload and download speeds. It uses the psutil library to get the network I/O counters and calculates the speeds. The script updates the GUI labels every second to show the current upload and download speeds.  Installation:  Install Python (if you haven't already) from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Install the psutil library using pip: pip install psutil Install the tkinter library (if you're using Python 3.x): pip install tk Making it executable on Windows:  Save the script as a .py file (e.g., network_speed_meter.py) Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell as an administrator Navigate to the directory where you saved the script Run the following command to create a standalone executable: pyinstaller --onefile network_speed_meter.py This will create a dist folder containing the executable file (e.g., network_speed_meter.exe) You can now run the executable by double-clicking on it Note: You may need to adjust the root.geometry line to set the initial window position and size to your liking.  Also, keep in mind that the ctypes.windll.user32.SetWindowPos line is used to set the window position to a specific location on the screen. You may want to remove this line or adjust it to suit your needs.
